Data

To help Dorothy in his search we will need to access following data:

- The Localities of Foshan, Guangzhou China from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these Localities of Foshan from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the burger joint venues of the Localities
  - the offices venues of the Localities
  - the high schools venues of the Localities
  - the universities venues of the Localities

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the burger joint.
